## Development:

You can use your own scripts by placing them in the `custom/` directory or using this template for
naming your files: `<name>.custom.cmake`

Every cmake file in this repository have the following code in the start of itself:

```cmake
if(EXISTS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/pre-<filename>.custom.cmake)
	include(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/pre-<filename>.custom.cmake)
endif()
```

and the following code in the end of itself:

```cmake
if(EXISTS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/pre-<filename>.custom.cmake)
	include(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/pre-<filename>.custom.cmake)
endif()
```

So, You can add your own behavior for every instance.
